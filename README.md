# Karen's Kryha code challenge

Hello!
Thank you for an interesting challenge. :)
Here are some notes to simply start/test the project.

## Preparation and dependencies

Just run `npm install` :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

ESLint was configured, so you can check any typescript/linter errors.

## Some notes
- I made all "Nice-to-have" points =)
- Added some screenshots
- The only 3rd party lib, that is adding some functionality os "react-toastify" (to show cute toasts) when the game is won
- A few tests added (just to show, that I know how to do it)
- Enjoy the game, made with ❤️!
